Blue Room Vulnerability Assessment & Exploitation Summary
1. Executive Summary-
   
A comprehensive security assessment and controlled exploitation phase were conducted against the target "Blue" environment within the authorized TryHackMe infrastructure. The primary objective was to validate the existence of critical legacy network vulnerabilities, specifically focusing on unpatched Server Message Block (SMB) file-sharing protocols, and evaluate the security impact of a successful remote code execution (RCE) compromise.

2. Key Findings & Exploitation Methodology-
   
The assessment targeted a legacy Windows operating system deployment using a systematic penetration testing lifecycle:

Vulnerability Scanning: Executed focused network enumeration targeting Port 445 (SMB) to detect structural flaws. 
The target system was identified as highly vulnerable to the historic MS17-010 (EternalBlue) vulnerability family.

Foothold Acquisition: Utilized the Metasploit framework (exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue) alongside a structured 
64-bit reverse TCP payload (windows/x64/shell/reverse_tcp) to inject specially crafted packets into the vulnerable SMBv1 
buffer, establishing an unauthenticated command shell foothold.

Privilege Escalation: Upgraded the initial command shell to an interactive Meterpreter session utilizing post-exploitation modules.
System privileges were verified as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM via the getsystem command utility.

Post-Exploitation & Looting: Successfully migrated unstable execution processes to a secure, persistent system process (migrate [PID]).
Executed a privileged hashdump to extract local Security Account Manager (SAM) database credential hashes for local non-default user
accounts, and located the three authorized target flags distributed across the core system directories.

3. Security Impact-
   
The presence of unpatched MS17-010 vulnerabilities introduces catastrophic exposure across external and internal networks.
Because EternalBlue triggers a non-paged kernel pool memory overflow, an unauthenticated remote attacker can completely subvert
operating system isolation layers to execute arbitrary code with maximum kernel-level privileges. This enables total data exfiltration,
system destruction, and lateral network propagation (such as worm-based ransomware deployment).

4. Remediation Recommendations-
   
To protect structural infrastructure assets from similar network-level exploits, the following mitigations must be deployed across
the PosBuzz Retail Solutions environment:

Decommission SMBv1 Protocols: Completely disable Server Message Block version 1 (SMBv1) native features globally across all client
and server operating systems via Group Policy Objects (GPO) or Server Manager configurations. Force systems to utilize modern,
secure SMBv2 or SMBv3 alternatives.

Apply Critical Security Updates: Mandate immediate deployment of Microsoft Security Bulletin MS17-010 patches across all legacy nodes,
and maintain strict, regular patch-cycle compliance schedules.

Restrict Inbound SMB Traffic: Configure perimeter and internal host-based firewalls to strictly block or drop inbound Port 445 communication
sequences originating from untrusted, public external networks.Blue Room Vulnerability Assessment & Exploitation Summary
